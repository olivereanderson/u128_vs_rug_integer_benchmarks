[Criterion](https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs) benchmarks comparing the performance of 128-bit unsigned integer with [rug's arbitrary precision Integers](https://docs.rs/rug/1.12.0/rug/struct.Integer.html) for values that can be represented by the u128 type. 

# Warning: 
[This benchmark does not work](benches/square.rs) does not work and is thus not included in Cargo.toml. See [this issue](https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/issues/480).
