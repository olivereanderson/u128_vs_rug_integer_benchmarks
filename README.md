Criterion benchmarks comparing the performance of 128-bit unsigned integer with rug's arbitrary precision Integers (where it makes sense to compare the two). 

# Warning: 
[This benchmark does not work](benches/square.rs) does not work and is thus not included in Cargo.toml. See [this issue](https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/issues/480).
